# 1 First we need Latest Python Version Interpreter 

# 2 Then we need to install Virtual enviroment
  - pip install virtualenv
  - virtual env myenviroment  
    - Virtual Environment is an isolated environment for a Python project,
      which ensures that dependencies (libraries) of one project donâ€™t affect others.
  - myenviroment\Scripts\activate 

  - Then we need to install packages ( pip install Django )
  - Using Django-admin we can see what commands are available and what we can use  

# 3 Create the project 
  - Django-admin startproject Django_name (create django file) 
  - cd Django_name              (goto the project directory)
  - python manage.py runserver (runs the server at port 8000)

# 4 Different file
  wsgi.py     -> web server gateway interface
  urls.py     -> List of urls path 
  asgi.py     -> Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface
  setting.py  -> All Project related Configurations (templates , others )



Avoid Dependency Conflicts:

Different projects can use different versions of the same library (e.g., Django 4.0 for one project, Django 3.2 for another).
Keep Development Clean:

Isolated Dependencies: Keeps libraries separate for each project.
No System Clutter: Clean project management.
Easy Sharing: Use pip freeze > requirements.txt for sharing dependencies.
